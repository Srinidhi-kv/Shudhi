# Shudhi: A must have Data science module

## Introduction

We are Data Science graduate students at Columbia University. We regularly analyse various datasets and the thing that bothers us the most is that the time & effort invested in the Processing and exploration phase is too much. This phase takes the most time in the Data Analysis journey (>50% time). It is extremely important to understand the dataset thoroughly before even thinking about ML models, but, most steps in the phase can be automated to save time and effort.

## Shudhi

Shudhi stands for purification in many Indian languages. The aim of this module is to Process and Exlpore the data with minimum effort.
